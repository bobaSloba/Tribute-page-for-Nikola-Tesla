          Nikola Tesla, (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]—died January 7, 1943, New York, New York, U.S.), Serbian American inventor and engineer who discovered and patented the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating-current machinery. He also developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission. He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.

        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Nikola Tesla's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>1856</strong> - Born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]</li>
          <li><strong>1862</strong> -Enrolls in first grade of elementary school in Smiljan</li>
          <li><strong>1863</strong> -Moves with family to Gospic</li>
          <li><strong>1863 — 1870</strong> -Completes elementary school and lower technical school in Gospic
Completed four years of elementary school in 1867 as an excellent pupil, and his name was entered in the school’s “Golden Book”.</li>
          <li><strong>1870 — 1873</strong> -Attends senior secondary technical school in Karlovac
The Rakovac senior secondary technical school was at that time a highly regarded institution at which pupils prepared for advanced technical studies.</li>
          <li><strong>1874</strong> -Contracts cholera
Despite his father’s demand that he not return to Gospic, where a cholera epidemic was raging, on graduating he returned home and became seriously ill. He would remain in bed for a full nine months.</li>
          <li><strong>1875 — 1877</strong> -Studies technical sciences in Graz
The Joanneum Polytechnic in Graz was one of four schools in Austria-Hungary which trained engineers.1878.</li>
          <li><strong>1878</strong> -Matica srpska in Novi Sad rejects application for stipendium
Matica Srpska had already rejected his first application, submitted on October 14, 1876. In his new application to the “celebrated Matica Srpska”, he asked for a stipendium to complete “engineering studies” in Vienna or Prague, but was refused a second time. Apparently he did not regard this as a slight from the oldest and most highly-regarded Serbian cultural, literary and scientific institution because, as a world-famous scientist, he became a member in 1902.</li>
          <li><strong>1878 — 1879</strong> -First employment in Maribor
Worked in a local technical company. Having insufficient funds to support himself, he was expelled by the city administration on March 8 and returned to Gospic under police escort.</li>
          <li><strong>1880</strong> -Studies natural philosophy at the Charles University in Prague</li>
          <li><strong>1881</strong> -Employed as engineer in Budapest
Thanks to family friend Ferenc Puskas, who was working with his brother Tivadar on installing the first telephone exchange in Budapest, Tesla obtained employment as a “chief electrician” in the Central Telephone Office. Here he built his first invention, a device for voice amplification on the telephone.</li>
          <li><strong>1882</strong> -Invention of the rotating magnetic field
Walking with his friend Anton Szigety in the Budapest City Park, watching the setting sun and reciting verses from Goethe’s “Faust”, he discovered the principle of creating a rotating magnetic field with alternating current.</li>
          <li><strong>1882</strong> -Employed by continental Edison company in Paris
At the end of the year, on the recommendation of Tivadar Puskas, Thomas Edison’s principal representative in Europe, Tesla began work repairing Edison’s machines, spending time in a number of places in France and Germany.</li>
          <li><strong>1909</strong> -Founds Tesla Propulsion Company
The goal of the new company, based at 165 Broadway, New York, was the exploitation of his mechanical engineering inventions.</li>
          <li><strong>1928</strong> -Final patent
In his 72nd year he was granted his final patent for “Apparatus for Aerial Transportation”. He was the first to imagine a flying machine with vertical take-off and landing, a combination of helicopter and fixed-wing which would be powered by his turbines.</li>
          <li><strong>January 7, 1943</strong> -Nikola Tesla dies at 86
Tesla died in his sleep, in his apartment on the 33rd floor of the New Yorker Hotel, where he had spent the last nine years of his life. A memorial service was held on January 10, broadcast live by Radio New York. New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia read the eulogy, which was written by Louis Adamic, the Slovenian writer, essayist and translator. Croatian violinist Zlatko Balokovic and the Sloven choir performed the Serbian patriotic song “Tamo daleko” (Far Away) at the memorial. The Royal Yugoslav Government Information Centre organized the ceremony of Tesla’s funeral and published an announcement about the protocol for it. Tesla’s remains lay in the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home. The funeral service was held on January 12, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. A delegation of thirty Yugoslav officers contributed to the ceremony. Nikola Tesla was interred in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale on January 12, 1943. Two and a half months after his death, on March 25, 1943, at the request of Sava Kosanovic, the remains of Nikola Tesla were cremated.</li>
<li><strong>1960</strong> -Highest recognition of Nikola Tesla
In 1960, Nikola Tesla’s immeasurable contribution to science was recognized. The 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures, held in Paris from October 11 to 20, 1960, passed a resolution naming the unit of magnetic induction in the International System of Units (Si system) the “tesla”. Thus Tesla joined fifteen of the greatest scientific giants, such as Newton, Faraday, Volta, Hertz, Ampère and Kelvin, and took his place in the temple of science for all time.</li>
